This powerful dua calls upon Allah ﷻ — Malik-ul-Quddus (The King, The Most Pure) — to cleanse our heart from all anger, jealousy, arrogance, and unlawful desires. It nurtures noble character — the kind that draws you closer to Allah ﷻ and His beloved Messenger, Rasulullah ﷺ.

*The Duʿāʾ:*  

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Malikul Quddus (O King, the Most Pure), grant us hearts that are pure and sound, free from all anger, malice, jealousy, envy, arrogance, pride, unlawful lust, and greed. Adorn us with the best and most noble character, inspired by Your beloved, Habeebullah, Sultan-ul-Anbiya, Rasoolullah, Sayyidina Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. Fill our hearts with a deep and unwavering love for him. Let this love purify our desires, guide our intentions, and transform our actions into those that are beloved and pleasing to You and Your beloved.

This duʿāʾ is part of the *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a growing chain of heartfelt duʿāʾs shared by countless believers like you, worldwide.

And because in an authentic hadith reported by Muʿādh ibn Anas (ra), Rasulullah ﷺ encouraged us to share beneficial knowledge, I humbly ask that you please forward this message far and wide — it only takes a few seconds, and your sharing can start a chain of duʿāʾs that continue returning to you from everyone it reaches.

When you share this message, you’re not simply sharing a duʿāʾ. You’re opening the door to countless people making sincere duʿāʾ for you daily — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying *“Ameen”* to every single one.

I make duʿāʾ that Allah accepts it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

*Ameen.*`;
