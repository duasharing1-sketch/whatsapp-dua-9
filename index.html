This powerful dua calls upon Allah ﷻ — Malik-ul-Quddus (The King, The Most Pure) — to cleanse our heart from all anger, jealousy, arrogance, and unlawful desires. It nurtures noble character — the kind that draws you closer to Allah ﷻ and His beloved Messenger, Rasulullah ﷺ.

It asks for inner purification and noble character, inspired by the most perfect human being to ever walk the earth: Khayr-ul-Khalqillah, Rasulullah ﷺ.

For when the heart is purified, the soul begins to shine — dressed with Divine light, blessings, and honor.

As Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:

“The most beloved to me and the closest to me on the Day of Judgment are those with the best character.” (Tirmidhi)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Malikul Quddus (O King, the Most Pure), grant us hearts that are pure and sound, free from all anger, malice, jealousy, envy, arrogance, pride, unlawful lust, and greed. Adorn us with the best and most noble character, inspired by Your beloved, Habeebullah, Sultan-ul-Anbiya, Rasoolullah, Sayyidina Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. Fill our hearts with a deep and unwavering love for him. Let this love purify our desires, guide our intentions, and transform our actions into those that are beloved and pleasing to You and Your beloved.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and from everyone it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
